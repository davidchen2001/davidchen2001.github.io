        I'm currently working as an Embedded Software Engineering Intern at Ciena.
        When I'm not programming or working, I like cooking, watching anime, and bouldering. I also occasionally maintain a blog. 
        I'd love to connect with you! Feel free to reach out on one of the following platforms.
